Though we have media controller to control our videoView. But since the the audio runs in background. Therefore there is no controller
to control audio directly. But we can control the audio through seekBars which i have used here.
In this i have used two seekBars 
1) VolumeSeekBar - To increase or decrease the volume of the song.
2) ProgressSeekBar - To make note of the progress of the song.
